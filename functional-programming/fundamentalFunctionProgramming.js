// Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome
// is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause 
// any side effects.


//////////////////////

// Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means
//  if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly 
//  into the function as an argument.

// Slice method in array is a functional approach because it return new array

//Functional Programming: Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);

//Functional Programming: Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

// Functional programming use map, filter, reduce instead of for loop, foreach loop.

//Functional Programming: Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method

//Functional Programming: Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method

//Functional Programming: Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria
