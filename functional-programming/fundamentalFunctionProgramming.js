// Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome
// is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause 
// any side effects.


//////////////////////

// Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means
//  if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly 
//  into the function as an argument.

// Slice method in array is a functional approach because it return new array
