//As we asserted in Chapter 1, JavaScript has typed values, not typed variables. 
//The following built-in types are available:

string
number
boolean
null 
ÃŸundefined
object 
symbol//(new to ES6)

// Except object all are primitve data types
a = null
typeof(a)// "object"  its a bug so take a special precaution when comparing null to object
